# This implements enough of the XDG spec to create .app bundles for desktop files.
# If someone cares enough about the convoluted XDG spec to implement it more fully,
# https://github.com/jceb/dex/blob/master/dex might be a good starting point.
# It is refreshing to see how straightforward things are in GNUstep compared to XDG.

# USAGE: $0 <desktop file or directory containing desktop files> [<destination directory>]
# or, to watch the system for new desktop files, just call it without arguments
